could you create a task in the current sprint 
in the implementation issue:
We need to create sub paths for the functions 
like so

Localhost:3000/api/<foldername>/<functionname>


We will extend the whole system next week so the path folder 
should be named /microsoft/graph/ if sub folders are possible
